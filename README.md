### Description and Credits

_Say hello to Editorial, a blog/magazine-ish template built around a toggleable "locking"  
sidebar (scroll down to see what I mean) and an accordion-style menu. Not the usual landing  
page/portfolio affair you'd expect to see at HTML5 UP, but I figured for my 41st (!!!)  
template I'd change it up a little. Enjoy :)_
