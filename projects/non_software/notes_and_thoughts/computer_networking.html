                                            <li>Expedited forwarding PHB specifies that the departure rate of a class of traffic must equal or exceed a configured rate

                                    <li>
                                        For a network to make guarantees, it must integrate call admission  
                                        <ul>
                                    <li>A flow must declare its QoS requirement, and have the network either accept the flow (at the required QoS) or block the flow
                                    <li>
                                        This requires the reservation of sufficient resources at each and every network router on its source-to-destination path (call setup)
