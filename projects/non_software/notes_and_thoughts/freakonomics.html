                                    <p>I loved reading this book. The ideas are consistently communicated in a clear and sensitive way. I love how data-driven every argument is. I particularly enjoyed the questions for the reader: which set of multiple choice answers contains modifications, which real-estate ad terms correlate with higher and lower sale prices, etc.</p>
                                    <p>Despite some scholastic experience with economics, I believe that this book is accessible to all. The book teaches one how to analyze information from the perspective of a rational, data-driven economist.</p>
                                    <p>There are some nice notes at the end of the book which add extra interesting details, and point towards referenced papers and datasets.</p>
