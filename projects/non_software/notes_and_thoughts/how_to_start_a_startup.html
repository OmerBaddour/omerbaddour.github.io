											No plan survives first contact with customers 
											<ul>
												<li>General planning comes before writing the business plan</li>

											Waterfall development assumes: 
											<ul>
												<li>That you know your customer problem
												<li>That you know your product features</li>
											</ul>
										<li>More startups fail from lack of customers than from failure of product development
										<li>Have processes to manage the engineering process, to minimize engineering risk, but need processes to minimize customer risk
										<li>
											Agile development 
											<ul>
												<li>Extreme programming: iteration and incremental delivery of the product, guided by customer feedback
												<li>Contrasts the traditional approach of building all possible features from the get-go</li>

											</ul>
										<li>
											Multi-sided markets / “users first” companies: prioritize users over revenue 
											<ul>

																<li>Example of trained doctors in India analyzing X-rays</li>
															</ul>
														<li>
															Direct suppliers   
															<ul>
																<li>Components
																<li>Raw materials
																<li>Not just a cost of goods — beneficial to view as a partnership</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
													</ul>
												<li>
													Traffic partners  
													<ul>
														<li>Long-term agreements with other companies to deliver long-term predictable levels of customers

													</ul>
												<li>
													Try to get sales deals rather than investment deals

															</ul>
														<li>Not appreciating that partners can be a potential acquirer, which is something you might want in the future</li>
